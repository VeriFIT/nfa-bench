# Extensive benchmark for reasoning about regular properties

This repository contains benchmark automata that can be used to evaluate
libraries accepting non-deterministic finite automata in .mata format.


## Usage


Similarly, to use `.mata` files you will need either some format converter or parser of
either of the formats.

## File formats

  * `.mata` is our own format (see [AUTOMATAFORMAT.md](https://github.com/VeriFIT/mata/blob/devel/AUTOMATAFORMAT.md))
  for various types of automata (AFA, NFA, DFA ,etc.) 

## Benchmark description


 1. `b-smt` contains 330 string constraints from the Norn and SyGuS-qgen, collected in
    <a href="http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/">SMT-LIB benchmark</a>, that fall in BRE.
    This includes following directories:
     * `bool_comb/ere/QF_SLIA_Norn`
     * `bool_comb/ere/QF_S_sygus_qgen`

 2. `b-regex`contains 500 problems, obtained analogously as in
    <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/pub/mfps17.pdf">[MFPS'17]</a>  and
    <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-030-89051-3_14">[APLAS'21]</a>,
    from <a href="https://regexlib.com/">RegExLib</a>.
    This includes following directories:
    * `email_filter`

 3. `b-hand-made` has 56 difficult handwritten problems from
    <a href="https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~cdstanford/doc/2021/PLDI21.pdf">[PLDI'21]</a>
    containing membership
    in regular expressions extended with intersection and complement. They encode (1)
    date and password problems, (2) problems where Boolean operations interact with
    concatenation and iteration, and (3) problems with exponential determinization.
    This includes following directories:
      * `bool_comb/ere/boolean_and_loops`
      * `bool_comb/ere/date`
      * `bool_comb/ere/det_blowup`
      * `bool_comb/ere/password`

 4. `b-armc-incl` contains 171 language inclusion problems from runs of abstract regular
    model checking tools (verification of the bakery algorithm, bubble sort, and a producer-
    consumer system) of <a href="http://www.lsv.fr/Publis/PAPERS/PDF/bhhtv-ciaa08.pdf">[CIAA'08]</a>.
    This includes following directories:
    * `automata-inclusion`

 5. `b-param` has 8 parametric problems. Four are from
<a href="https://jorgenavas.github.io/papers/regex-tacas13.pdf">[TACAS'13]</a>.
Another four are from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09073">[arXiv'17]</a>.
    This includes following directories:
      * `bool_comb/cox`
      * `bool_comb/intersect`

 6. `z3-noodler` contains automata obtained from the <a href="https://github.com/VeriFIT/z3-noodler">z3-noodler</a> string solver together with the intended automata operations that are applied within the tool. 
   The automata were generated during solving constraints from the `SMT Competition` and includes following directories: 
      * `automatark`: (the underlying SMT benchmark <a href="https://clc-gitlab.cs.uiowa.edu:2443/SMT-LIB-benchmarks/QF_S/-/tree/master/20230329-automatark-lu">QF_S/20230329-automatark-lu</a>)

 7. `presburger` contains a subset of the NFAs from the benchmark for evaluation of deciding LIA
    using an automata-based decision procedure originally descibed in <a
    href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-61064-2_27">CAAP'96</a> extended to
    integers. The nondeterminism in these automata is typically a consequence of an existential
    quantiﬁer ∃x in the input formula; this is usually expressed as a so called projection that
    corresponds to removing the tracks in the encoding corresponding to variable from the alphabet.
    Furthermore, the benchmark includes only NFAs that need to be determinized in order to compute
    the complement of their language (this corresponds to a negation in the input formula). The
    used LIA formulae can be found in the LIA SMT-COMP category, under the UltimateAutomizer 1
    (generated by the tool UltimateAutomizer, see, e.g. <a
    href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-39799-8_2">CAV'13</a>) and tptp 2
    (from the The TPTP Problem Library, see, e.g. <a
    href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-017-9407-7">Journal of Automated
    Reasoning 2017</a> ) folders. This includes following directories:
      * `presburger/complement`

 8. `regexps` contains automata generated from regular expressions. The expressions
    originate from various sources, one of them 
    being <a href="https://www.snort.org/">Snort</a>. The README file in the directory
    contains more information on the process of generating the automata.

 9. `ws1s` contains automata that were generated during WS1S decision making.
    The `gaston` folder contains the automata generated from the examples used 
    in the <a href="https://www.fit.vutbr.cz/research/groups/verifit/tools/gaston/.cs">Gaston</a> 
    project, and the `easy` folder contains simplified versions of them. More information
    about the origin of the automata is in the README file in the `ws1s` directory.



## Contributing

Our repositories are open for forking, enabling interested individuals to explore,
modify, and build upon our codebase. We wish to extend this benchmark with other 
problems and sources that could enhance the comparison of all widely used and presented tools.

If you are interested in contributing your own benchmark
we suggest following:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your own benchmark formulae, preferably in `.mata` format. See our format 
   description above. If you need help with converting your format into one of our formats
   contact us.
3. Create a Pull Request from your fork. We will check your contribution, optionally request
   changes and if we are satisfied, we will merge the changes into our repository.
4. Please, in your pull request include the following:
   * Describe your benchmark: how it was obtained, whether it was generated, the origin of the 
     problem it models, etc.
   * If your benchmark is part of some paper or other work, please include citation to these works.
